# secret-sharing
Three prominent secret sharing algorithms implemented in managed C++ (.Net).
The repository provides an efficient implementation of Shamir, Benaloh-Leichter Generalized Access Structure, and Schoenmakers (publicly verifiable secret sharing) schemes.
Chaum-Peterson's non-interactive zero-knowledge protocol (a prerequisite of the Schoenmakers scheme) is also implemented.
